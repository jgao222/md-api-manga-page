# md-api-manga-page

This project is an attempt at using the MangaDex API to do basic tasks that the
website used to do, given that the front-end MangaDex site is not up. It doesn't
work because of CORS preventing it being entirely client side, and I haven't
learned enough server-side to figure out how to do it like that. I may come back
and update it if I have time later, but it is unlikely.
